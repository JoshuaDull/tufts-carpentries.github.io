![The Carpentries Logo](/images/tC.png)

[The Carpentries'](https://carpentries.org/) workshops are hands-on two-day events that cover the core skills needed to be productive in a small team. Instruction sessions are integrated with practical exercises, and all instruction is done via live coding.

**Software Carpentry** workshops focus on automating tasks, how to track and share work using version control, and how to write software that is readable, reusable, and reliable.

**Data Carpentry** workshops are domain-specific, and follow a narrative structure, working with one dataset through the whole data lifecycle from project organization to visualization.
 
**Library Carpentry** workshops are designed to help library professionals. Lessons include SQL, web scraping, data cleaning and tidying. It is not formally associated with the Carpetries.

The New England Software Carpentry Library Consortium ([NESCLiC](https://nesclic.github.io/)) is an association of academic libraries, joined as a community of practice focused on building data science skills in research computing, and extracting, wrangling, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. As a member of NESCLiC, Tufts University shares a Gold-level membership in the Carpentries with the other member schools. Tufts has been a member of NESCLiC since it's creation in 2017.
